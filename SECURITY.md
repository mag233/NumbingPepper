# Security

## Reporting a vulnerability
Please use GitHub Security Advisories to report security issues.
If that is not available, open an issue and mark it as sensitive; maintainers will move the discussion to a private channel.

## Scope
- Desktop and web builds
- Local data handling (SQLite, localStorage, files)
- API key storage and external requests

## Response
We aim to acknowledge reports within 7 days and provide a fix timeline when confirmed.
